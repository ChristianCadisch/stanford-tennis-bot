# Stanford West Campus Tennis Court Reservation Bot ðŸŽ¾ðŸ¤–

![bot](https://github.com/ChristianCadisch/stanford-tennis-bot/blob/main/Image.jpg)

## Purpose

This project is designed to automate the reservation process for tennis courts at Stanfordâ€™s West Campus. The bot logs into the Club Locker website, navigates to the reservations page, and selects the ideal time slots (prioritizing times after 6 PM). The script uses Selenium for web automation and can be customized to move a specified number of days ahead to make future reservations.

### Prerequisites

* Login to Stanford's Club Locker System
* Python 3.6 or higher
* Google Chrome browser
* ChromeDriver (compatible with your version of Chrome)

## Installation
### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tennis-court-reservation.git
cd tennis-court-reservation
```

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment

For macOS and Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
```

For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv .env
.env\Scripts\activate
```
### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 4: Download ChromeDriver

Download ChromeDriver from the official [ChromeDriver download page](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads). Choose the version that matches your installed version of Google Chrome.
Extract the downloaded file and move it to a location in your systemâ€™s PATH or specify its location in the script.

### Step 5: Adust auth.json File
Add your Club Locker login info to the auth.json file in the project directory:

### Step 6: Make the Bash Script Executable (macOS and Linux)
```bash
chmod +x run_reserve.sh
```
### Step 7: Running the Script ðŸŽ‰
Just double click on the run_reserve.sh file ðŸª„


## Notes

* The script prioritizes reservation slots after 6 PM (6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 8:00 PM). If these slots are unavailable, it will attempt to reserve earlier slots.
* Ensure your chromedriver path is correctly specified in reserve.py.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that:

* The auth.json file contains correct login credentials.
* ChromeDriver is compatible with your installed version of Google Chrome.
* The virtual environment is activated before running the script.

Feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository if you have any questions or run into problems.
